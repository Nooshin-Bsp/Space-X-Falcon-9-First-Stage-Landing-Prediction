# Supervised Learning
# Space-X-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
# PROJECT BACKGROUND AND CONTEX:
# In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 
# million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, and much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. The project task is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch.

# Data collection methodology
# Space-X launch date gathered from Space-X Rest API (this data gives information about launchs, including information about the rocket, payload mass, launch specification, and landing outcome) web Scrapping from Wikipedia

# Perform data wrangling
# Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizaion Perform predictive analysis using classification method: LR,KNN,SVM,DT models have been builed and evaluated for the best classifier

# Results
# The SVM,KNN, and LR models are the best in the term of prediction accuracy for this dataset. Low weighted payloads performs perform better than the heavier payloads.
